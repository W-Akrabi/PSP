# Prediction Student Performance

This project is a machine learning pipeline for predicting student grades based on various features such as age, scholarship type, and study habits. The pipeline involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, oversampling, and training a neural network model to classify student grades into different categories.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the complete pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data_col.csv`: Sample dataset used for training and evaluating the model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imblearn`
- `tensorflow`

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash 
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn imbalanced-learn tensorflow
